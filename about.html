			<h2>From Law to Code</h2>
			<p>I graduated from Arizona State University and Obtained Master of Law degree last December. Instead of going back to Taiwan to seek a legal employment, I decided to explore other options in the states. Web development struke me as a perfect area to explore and pursue as a new career after hearing lots of stories and doing lots of research. My journey to become a web developer began since then, and now I believe I am ready for my first web developer job.</p>
			<h2>Fast Learner</h2>
			<p>Learning new things everyday has become my new source of joy and my new habit. Because of my fast learning pace, I managed to complete the curriculum on Flatiron Learn Verified Online Program in 4 months–it normally takes 6 months to complete,  And now I am ready for my first job as a web developer. Lots of learning ahead I know, that is what makes this path exciting and attractive to me!</p>
			<h2>Proven Team Player</h2>
			<p>Although I am new to tech, I believe the ability to work well with others is the requirement that every business has in common. I was considered a team player by the employers and coworkers in my previous work experience, thus I believe I can blend in a team quickly and make contributions.</p>
